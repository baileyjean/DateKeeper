## Description
With our busy lives, it seems nearly impossible to keep the romance and excitement alive in a relationship--there's just so much information to track! **Cupid's Quiver** is here to help! 

Relationships can be such a wonderful thing, but how do you keep track of dates you want to go on, dates you've been on, and all the beautiful attributes of your partner? What about gift ideas? I can't tell you how many times I've scrambled to find the perfect gift for my partner, and it always feels like I could've put more thought into it once the gift is given. Or the number of times I've come up with some AWESOME date idea that never gets implemented because I keep forgetting about it. 

**Cupid's Quiver** removes all the frustration from this part of your romantic life, and makes it easy for you and your partner to enjoy each other. Let **Cupid's Quiver** be the brains for your heart. <3

## Getting Started
Users can enjoy Nerdy Nomad without ever logging in or creating an account, but all interactive portions of the site are blocked using conditional rendering. Once the user signs up or signs in, they get the full enjoyment of adding science centers to the database, personalizing their profiles, commenting on science centers, and rating science centers! The side nav bar on the site makes navigation across pages easy, and most pages are equipped with back buttons to return the user to the home page (for those who don't want to use the back button in the browser).
